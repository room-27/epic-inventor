epic-inventor
=============

07/17/2021 - I added a pom.xml file to make this project easier to build/run.

with the added pom, you just need to run "mvn package" to create a runnable jar.
Then execute the jar with "java -jar target/epicinventor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"

Have fun! -Jonathan Corbin

It's been a great journey developing this game.  We're releasing it open-source
to the community in the hopes that others will continue on where we left off
and make fun stuff.

If you do create and release something based on this code, or just want to
say hi, give us a shout out.

Enjoy :)
